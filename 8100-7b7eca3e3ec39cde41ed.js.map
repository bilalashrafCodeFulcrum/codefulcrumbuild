This is true about the absolute majority of\n        products nowadays, but the term “product design” holds a very special\n        place in the web and mobile development industry in particular.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Product design is the process of developing a new product to meet\n        customer needs and solve problems.

Therefore, it is not just about\n        creating an attractive look for your application. Product design,\n        encompassing both user experience and user interface design, is\n        responsible for addressing the app’s functionality and potential.
