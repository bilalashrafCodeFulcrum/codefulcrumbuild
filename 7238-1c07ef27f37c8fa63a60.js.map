A\n        custom-made application is built with your business needs in mind from\n        the start.

That's why we ask you about your values and key\n        expectations before proceeding to the development process.

However, you should always try\n          asking around and look for genuine reviewers on platforms such as\n          Clutch.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          {\" \"}\n          <span> Meet the team.</span> You typically won’t get to know your app\n          developers as well as your business partners, nevertheless you will be\n          working closely with them for a few months. Make sure you share a good\n          personality fit before starting any project.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span> Consider your needs.</span> There are different companies out\n          there using different software. Some specialize in one thing, like\n          databases, while others are more general and focus on multiple areas\n          of expertise.

Ask yourself if you like their style, their area of expertise,\n          and their approach to clients—all of these can become critical issues\n          if overlooked in the very beginning;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>Ask questions.</span> Be sure to share your product idea with\n          the company you're exploring working with and also be transparent\n          about what you need from them. The good companies will take this\n          mutual openness as an opportunity to develop a project that's in\n          everyone's best interests. Don’t be afraid to talk, to ask questions,\n          and to receive guidance.
